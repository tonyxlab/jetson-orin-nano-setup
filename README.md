# Jetson Orin Nano Setup

This repository documents my personal setup process for the Jetson Orin Nano — including OS installation, package configuration, CUDA/cuDNN environments, AI frameworks, optimization tools, troubleshooting logs, and performance notes.

> Intended as both a personal reference and a helpful guide for others, this repo will continue to grow over time as I explore new setups, test different tools, and refine my development environment.

## 🚀 Why This Repo

Since the Jetson Nano 4GB days, I’ve always enjoyed experimenting with NVIDIA’s edge AI devices.  
But every time I set up a new system, the information I needed was scattered across YouTube tutorials, Medium articles, GitHub repos, forums, and countless discussions.  
No single guide matched the environment or setup I actually wanted.

This repository exists to change that.

It consolidates everything I’ve tested and confirmed on the **Jetson Orin Nano**, including:

- OS installation on SSD   
- CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT setup  
- Python environments
- Libraries required for YOLO, LLMs, and vision tasks  
- Performance tuning  
- Common issues and real fixes  

It serves as a clean, reproducible reference for my future setups — and hopefully a helpful resource for anyone building their own Orin Nano environment.
